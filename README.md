## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A [Memberstack account](https://memberstack.com) (free plan available)
- **Recommended**: [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with [Context7 MCP](https://github.com/context7-ai/mcp-server) for AI-powered development

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/julianmemberstack/memberstack-claude-boilerplate.git
cd memberstack-claude-boilerplate
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Add your Memberstack keys
# Get them from: https://app.memberstack.com/apps/[your-app-id]/devtools
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEMBERSTACK_KEY=pk_sb_your_public_key_here
MEMBERSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_your_secret_key_here
```

### 3. Create Your Plans in Memberstack
Create your pricing plans in the [Memberstack dashboard](https://app.memberstack.com) with whatever structure works for your business:

- **Free Plan** - Basic features
- **Premium Plan** - Advanced features  
- **Enterprise Plan** - Full access
- Or any custom structure that fits your needs!

### 4. Auto-Generate Configuration
Instead of manually configuring plans, let the boilerplate analyze your Memberstack setup:

```bash
# Automatically generate auth configuration from your Memberstack plans
npm run setup:memberstack
```

This will:
- ✅ Fetch all your plans from Memberstack
- ✅ Analyze pricing structure and features
- ✅ Generate optimized auth configuration
- ✅ Create plan-based access control rules
- ✅ Suggest features and permissions for each tier

### 5. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your application! 🎉

### 🤖 Let Claude Help Configure Your Plans
You can also ask Claude to analyze your Memberstack setup:

```bash
# This creates an API endpoint Claude can use to analyze your plans
curl http://localhost:3000/api/memberstack/plans
```

Claude can then provide personalized recommendations for your specific plan structure!

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Client-Side Authentication
1. **MemberstackProvider** wraps the app with auth context
2. Provides real-time auth state to all components
3. Handles login, logout, and signup operations
4. Manages session persistence with cookies

### Server-Side Protection
1. **Middleware** intercepts all requests
2. Validates user authentication and plan access
3. Redirects unauthorized users appropriately
4. Prevents exposure of protected content

### Plan-Based Access Control
- **Route-level**: Protect entire pages based on user plans
- **Component-level**: Show/hide UI elements conditionally
- **Feature-level**: Enable/disable functionality per plan

## 🎯 Key Components

### Dashboard
A professional dashboard with:
- **Responsive sidebar navigation** with plan-based menu items
- **User profile display** with current plan information
- **Feature showcase cards** with upgrade prompts
- **Usage metrics** and analytics (plan-gated)
- **Account management** and logout functionality

### Authentication Demo
A complete auth interface featuring:
- **Email/password authentication** with validation
- **Google OAuth integration** (ready to enable)
- **Tabbed login/signup interface** with shadcn/ui
- **Real-time auth state display**
- **Error handling and success messages**

### Middleware Protection
Automatic route protection with:
- **Plan-based route access** control
- **Custom redirect URLs** for different scenarios
- **Debug logging** in development mode
- **Efficient auth validation** with caching

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Protected Routes
```typescript
// In lib/auth-config.ts
{
  path: "/new-feature",
  requiredPlans: ["pln_premium", "pln_enterprise"],
  customRedirect: "/pricing"
}
```

### Creating Plan-Gated Components
```typescript
import { useAuthConfig } from "@/contexts/AuthConfigContext";

export function PremiumFeature() {
  const { hasFeatureAccess } = useAuthConfig();
  const access = hasFeatureAccess(member, "premium-feature");
  
  return access.hasAccess ? (
    <PremiumContent />
  ) : (
    <UpgradePrompt />
  );
}
```

### Customizing Plans
```typescript
// Add new plans in lib/auth-config.ts
"pln_startup": {
  id: "pln_startup",
  name: "Startup Plan",
  features: ["team-collaboration", "advanced-analytics"],
  permissions: ["read", "write"],
  priority: 2.5
}
```

## 🎨 UI Customization

### Adding shadcn/ui Components
```bash
# Install any shadcn/ui component
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]

# Examples:
npx shadcn@latest add table
npx shadcn@latest add chart
npx shadcn@latest add calendar
```

### Theming
- Modify CSS variables in `app/globals.css`
- Update Tailwind config for custom colors
- Use shadcn/ui theme generator for color schemes

## 🚀 Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEMBERSTACK_KEY=pk_your_production_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on every push

### Other Platforms
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🧪 Development & Testing

### Available Scripts
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint

# Testing
npm run test         # Run tests once
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report

# Analysis
npm run analyze      # Analyze bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

### Testing
The project includes a comprehensive test setup with Jest and React Testing Library:

```typescript
// Example: Testing auth utilities
import { hasRouteAccess } from "@/lib/auth-utils";

describe("Authentication", () => {
  it("should allow access to dashboard for authenticated users", () => {
    const mockMember = { 
      id: "123", 
      planConnections: [{ planId: "pln_free", active: true }] 
    };
    
    const result = hasRouteAccess(mockMember, "/dashboard");
    expect(result.hasAccess).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Bundle Analysis
Analyze your app's bundle size and dependencies:
```bash
npm run analyze
```
This will build your app and open a detailed bundle analysis report.
